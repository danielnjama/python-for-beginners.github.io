# 1. Introduction to ```python

# 2. Variables and Data Types


# 3.Control Flow and Conditionals

1. Checking Even or Odd Number
- Write a Python program that checks if a given number is even or odd using conditional statements.
```python
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{num} is Even")
else:
    print(f"{num} is Odd")
```
2. Print First 10 Prime Numbers
- Create a script that prints the first 10 prime numbers.
```python
count = 0
num = 2
while count < 10:
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            break
    else:
        print(num, end=" ")
        count += 1
    num += 1
```
3. Exam Pass or Fail
- Develop a script that determines whether a student has passed or failed an exam based on their score. Assume the passing mark is 50.
```python
score = int(input("Enter your score: "))
if score >= 50:
    print("You passed the exam!")
else:
    print("You failed the exam.")
```
4. Categorizing Temperature
- Create a program that categorizes a given temperature as Hot, Moderate, or Cold based on user-defined thresholds.
```python
temp = float(input("Enter the temperature in Â°C: "))
if temp >= 30:
    print("Hot")
elif 15 <= temp < 30:
    print("Moderate")
else:
    print("Cold")
```
5. Sum of Numbers in a Range
- Write a Python program that uses a for loop to calculate the sum of numbers in a given range.
```python
start = int(input("Enter start of range: "))
end = int(input("Enter end of range: "))
total = 0
for i in range(start, end + 1):
    total += i
print(f"Sum of numbers from {start} to {end} is {total}")
```

6. Iterating Through a Dictionary of Students
- Create a script that iterates through a dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades, displaying a message for each student's performance.
```python
students = {"Alice": 85, "Bob": 72, "Charlie": 90, "David": 45}

for name, grade in students.items():
    if grade >= 90:
        print(f"{name}: Outstanding!")
    elif grade >= 75:
        print(f"{name}: Excellent!")
    elif grade >= 60:
        print(f"{name}: Good job!")
    else:
        print(f"{name}: Needs Improvement.")

```
7. Finding the Largest Number
- Write a program that takes three numbers as input and determines the largest using conditional statements.
```python
a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
c = int(input("Enter third number: "))

if a >= b and a >= c:
    largest = a
elif b >= a and b >= c:
    largest = b
else:
    largest = c

print(f"The largest number is {largest}")
```
8. Number Guessing Game
- Create a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 20. Use a while loop to allow multiple attempts until the user guesses correctly.
```python
import random

secret = random.randint(1, 20)
guess = 0

while guess != secret:
    guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 20: "))
    if guess < secret:
        print("Too low!")
    elif guess > secret:
        print("Too high!")
    else:
        print("Congratulations! You guessed it.")
```
9. Multiplication Table
- Write a Python script that prints the multiplication table for a user-defined number up to 10.
```python
num = int(input("Enter a number to print its multiplication table: "))
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{num} x {i} = {num * i}")
```
10. Using break and continue
- Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10, but stops at 6 using the break statement.
(a) Using break
```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i == 6:
        break
    print(i)
```
(b) Using continue
- Modify the program to skip even numbers using the continue statement.
```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)
```


# 4. Functions and Modules
### 1. Write a Python function that calculates and returns the square of a given number.

```python
def square(num):
    return num ** 2
```

---

### 2. Write a function that takes a person's name as input and prints a greeting message.

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome.")
```

---

### 3. Define a function that takes a number as input and checks if it is even or odd.

```python
def check_even_odd(num):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{num} is Even")
    else:
        print(f"{num} is Odd")

        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5)+1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

```python
# use_prime.py
import prime_checker

print(prime_checker.is_prime(7))  # True
print(prime_checker.is_prime(10)) # False
```

---

### 15. Develop a module (greetings.py) that defines a function to greet users based on the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening). Import and test it in a separate script.

# greetings.py
def greet_by_time(hour):
    if 5 <= hour < 12:
        return "Good morning!"
